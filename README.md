## Todo App

A simple To-Do application that allows users to create, edit, and delete tasks. Users can organize their tasks into three categories: "Not Started," "In Progress," and "Completed." The application also allows users to drag and drop tasks between the categories. The application uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for its implementation.
Getting Started

The application can be run locally by opening the index.html file in a web browser.
